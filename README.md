# chrome_ext_search

Blue Team utility used to find local Chrome extension IDs on a local PC.  It will only search for the current user that you are signed in with.  There is an option to search for the extesnions online, internet connection needed, or to continue in Offline mode.

Online mode returns extesnion ID #s and the extensions' names (if found).

Offline mode returns only the extension ID #s with "n/a" as the value.

Currently only Chrome on Windows is supported.

Tested on:

    Windows 11 Pro 24H2

## Future Goals

- [ ] Include Mac Support.
- [ ] Include support for Safari, Fire Fox, and Edge.
- [ ] Search the entire system for all users, not just the current signed in user.
